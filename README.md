# DanceCtl
This a custom software written for the Arduino, meant to replace the PCB inside an L-tek Dance Pad.

To download the Arduino Software:
 - Click "Clone or Download" in the top right.
 - Open up the zip, and run "DanceCtl.ino"
 - Arduino will ask you to copy it to a new path, hit "OK"
 - Then, set your software for your Arduino (this is written for a Micro/Leonardo, so likely one of those two).
 - Upload, and you're done!
 - Good luck with the soldering!
